  *Do you love live local music? Do you love set times?? I do too!\

  That's why I started Austindie Music about a year ago, to get the good stuff
  out and leave all the hoo ha at the door. We all know there is ALOT of live
  music in Austin and what comes with that is alot of noise so i'm here to try
  and clarify/ simplify it all on a platform you're already using! This page is
  for the people, the show goers, the listeners and ultimately for the artist in
  hopes that you all can navigate the scene more easily. -Sheebie*
