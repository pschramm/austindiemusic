That's why I started Austindie Music about a year ago, to get the good stuff out and leave all the hoo ha at the door. We all know there is ALOT of live music in Austin and what comes with that is alot of noise so i'm here to try and clarify/ simplify it all on a platform you're already using! This page is for the people, the show goers, the listeners and ultimately for the artist in hopes that you all can navigate the scene more easily. -Sheebie
